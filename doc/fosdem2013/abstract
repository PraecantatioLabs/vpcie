VPCIE: an open source PCIE endpoint virtualization framework


* abstract
----------

ESRF (http://www.esrf.eu) operates a source of XRAY light to serve fundamental
research and industry. Part of its activities involves developing electronics
and software for XRAY detectors. These are complex and long term projects, and
it can take years before first prototypes get available. From a software
development perspective, it can be difficult to validate and iterate over an
implementation without hardware. This is especially true when working on device
drivers.

In this talk, we present VPCIE (https://github.com/texane/vpcie), an open
source PCIE device virtualization framework developed at ESRF in the context
of a fast data acquisition project supported by the CRISP initiative
(http://www.crisp-fp7.eu). Relying on the flexible QEMU hardware virtualizer
(http://wiki.qemu.org) and the GHDL VHDL frontend for GCC (http://ghdl.free.fr),
it allows a software engineer to work without the target hardware being available.
Others benefits include shortening the time required to prototype FPGA based PCIE
endpoints.

The platform is still in early development, and this talk hopes to gather
feedbacks, ideas and eventual contributions from interested people.
